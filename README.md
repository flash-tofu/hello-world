nothing, just for fun

June 3rd, rainy 
it's the second day I come to this company. At the begin, I feel sad and unhappy. However, with time goes by, I think it's a chance for me to learn something new, and when I'm away from school.I don't need to do shit for the reason of my teacher. It's nice, what's more, this job pay me about ten times than my teacher do.
Make good use of this time, don't let it just slip away.
